# Eleme-Decision-Prediction
-	Select features of interest and created dummy variables. Split data into train and test tests, and try different models. Compare out-of-sample prediction scores to select the final model and handle outliers. Received 10/10 as final grade  
-	For classification: examine logistic regression, random forest, kNN (standardize features) and decision tree models. Use cross-validation to fine tune the regularization parameter and select the best model using AUC 
-	For regression: examine linear regression, decision tree, XGBT and random forest models. Also use cross validation and select the best model by R^2. Try clustering to improve the score and principal component analysis to improve accuracy
